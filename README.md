# hello-world
This is my first attempt at doing anything on github. 

So I should probably tell the world a little about myself. My handle on most of the internet is ke5mkt. That is also my ham radio callsign. I currently work as a cabinetmaker in Andrews, TX and am working to change my life by learning to code and becoming a web developer.

I use a Lemote Yeeloong netbook and pretty much try to stay FOSS.

I am married and have four sons, one cat, and six chickens.
